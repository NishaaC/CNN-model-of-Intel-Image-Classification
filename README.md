This project classifies images from the Intel Image Classification dataset into six categories: mountain, glacier, forest, street, buildings, and sea. It includes experiments with a custom CNN and a transfer learning model using MobileNetV2. The project demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning, achieving a test accuracy of 87.85%. It features comprehensive documentation, including methodology, hyperparameter tuning, and model comparisons. The repository provides a complete Python notebook with code and results, offering insights for replicating and improving the experiments.
